Hi, I'm Moumen Alaoui.


![MOumen Alaoui](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c35ed30-64b7-4e66-965b-ea5a41c07799)


I'm currently an undergraduate student at Michigan State University, double majoring in Data Science and Statistics. I’m passionate about applying computational techniques like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning (ML) to scientific research, especially in my core areas of interest: Finance and Physics. Currently, I'm involved in two personal research projects:

1. Financial Trading Algorithm: I’m designing an algorithm capable of making autonomous trading decisions that balance risk and reward. Leveraging historical stock price data, this algorithm utilizes advanced ML and RL methods to forecast stock movements and optimize long-term returns.

2. Fusion Plasma Stability Prediction: In my second project, I’m developing a machine learning model to predict plasma instabilities in fusion reactors. The model processes real-time sensor data to anticipate and mitigate instabilities, contributing to safer and more efficient fusion energy research.
